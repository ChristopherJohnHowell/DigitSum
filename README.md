# DigitSum
### Provides a Command Line Interface.

A simple program that can be executed from the command line, as follows:
1. Takes a single numeric input that must be an integer
2. Using recursion, writes to the console the sum of the digits in that number.
  e.g. entering 17 prints “8” and entering 1234 prints “10”
